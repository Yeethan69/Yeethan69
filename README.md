## Projects
***[Forza Mods AIO](https://github.com/ForzaMods/Forza-Mods-AIO)*** ([Archived](https://github.com/ForzaMods/AIO))

This was my first major coding and reversing project, and it all stemmed from [my first cheat for Forza Horizon 4](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-games/415227-fh4-speed-hack.html)

I evntually joined a Forza modding community server to share this, and that is where I met like minded individuals, and I got the idea to make something much bigger with another developer [ItsLogic](https://github.com/ItsLogic).

At some point after, I joined a University, and that took over, meaning I had less time to work on this project, so I gathered some other developers such as [szaaamerik](https://github.com/szaaamerik) and I took a step back.

I am still somewhat involved in the background, with the discord server and organisation.

***[DriverSF](https://github.com/Yeethan69/DriverSF)***

A dll that enables some previously disabled debug/dev menus, with the added functionality of dumping loaded compiled lua scripts, overwriting them with (user) decompiled lua scripts, and loading of comepletely custom lua scripts.

The console also takes input to pass to the lua engine.

This project has taught me lua scripting and hooking and directx hooking/developing to a very small extent.

***Other***

I also have private projects that include Java/Kotlin android development, amongst other things.
